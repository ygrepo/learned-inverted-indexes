# Learned Inverted Index
An inverted index is the basic data structure used in most current, large-scale
information retrieval systems. Many compression techniques for inverted indexes
have been studied in the past, with some reaching significant compression ratios,
while preserving query time efficiency. In this project, we aim to use Deep Learning
models to replace the index structure, resulting in better compression of the inverted
index. We present results that indicate that with further refinement this learned
inverted index structure can reduce memory requirements and provide a novel
approach to learned compression.
